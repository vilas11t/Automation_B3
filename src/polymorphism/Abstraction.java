/*
	 Abstraction- Hiding complexity details is called abstraction.
	 
	1. Abstract Class
    2. Interface
    
    Abstract Class- Declared with Abstract keyword.
        - abstract as well as non abstract method.
          non abstract method- only defination(declaration) not body ex- int add();
          There should be atleast one abstract method.
        - we can not create object of abstract class.
          need to extends abstract class to another child class, by using child object we can call abstract class method.
        - have constructors
        
        - We know partial implemetation details we go for abstract class.
        
        - 0-100% - abstraction can be achieved
           
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 Interface-
	   - it is blueprint of class it contains only abstract method and final variables.
	   - method- by default public and abstract weather we declare or not (up to java 1.8)  (for 1.9 we can have static as well as private method)
	   - Variable- by default- public , static and final we we declare or not 
	   - we can not create object
	   -Interface must be implemented by another class, if class A implements interface then it must implement 
	     all abstract methods of interface. if not by class A then it must done by its child class.
	   - 100% abstraction.
